title: Slang / slang-rhi chain records
description: Per-chain records for shader-slang issue and PR work driven through this orchestrator

# Slang chains

Per-chain state for shader-slang work. One file per issue/PR chain; open the file before
acting on a chain — these hold verified receipts (shas, job ids, log line numbers) that
decay and must be re-read, not remembered.

## Map

- [slang-rhi#787 — CUDA↔Vulkan shared-texture missing sync](rhi-787-cuda-vulkan-shared-sync.md) —
  real missing `VK_QUEUE_FAMILY_EXTERNAL` ownership release, not a tolerance flake. Draft PR #812,
  GPU-CI runtime-verified, APPROVE_WITH_NITS. **Open items:** maintainer confirmation of the point-3
  deviation; pre-existing dedicated-allocation asymmetry to file after #812 lands.
